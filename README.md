Mezuri Platform - Research in Change Group, University of Washington
===============
The Mezuri Platform is a hardware and software system for end-to-end management of data from development interventions. Read more about it on this [Mezuri](http://dil.berkeley.edu/data-analytics-toolkits/mezuri-platform/) article. The platform is still in development and so the code is not publicly available yet.

### Research
I spent Summer 2014 working on research in the field of Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICTD) in Gaetano Borriello's lab at the UW CSE department. I specifically worked on developing the cloud-based data storage for the Mezuri Platform. Building on an existing data management platform [ODK Aggregate](https://opendatakit.org/use/aggregate/) developed by the research group I built Mezuri's cloud datastore service. The datastore service was built on top of [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs) for database storage and [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs) for blob storage. It was built as a REST Interface that has been made compatible with the [ODK 2.0](https://code.google.com/p/opendatakit/wiki/REST_Synchronization_API) interface. During the 10 weeks that I worked here, I learnt a lot about database design, data management, REST interface design and dealing with production code.
